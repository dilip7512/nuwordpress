                        LIC of India Act 1956. Today, despite over 25 years of private competition, LIC continues to be
                        the life insurance leader by a huge margin. LIC has over 28.5 crore in-force policies and its
                        policyholder population would make it the fourth largest country in the world. As of March 2021,
                        LIC had a market share of 64.5% in terms of new business premiums (NBP) in individual and group
                        policies put together.<br /><br />
                        The leadership of LIC is visible from the fact that the second largest player in the life
                        insurance business in India has a market share of just about 7.8%. If you consider the
                        indicative valuation of LIC at a likely $200 billion, it will be the second most valuable
                        insurer in the world. LIC has a network 8 zonal offices, 113 divisional offices and 4,700 branch
                        and satellite office network. LIC also has an army of 13 lakh feet-on-street agents.</div>

                            <p>When the government announced the LIC IPO on 13th February and filed its draft red
                              herring prospectus (DRHP), one of the key requirements for LIC policyholders was to
                              complete the linking of their PAN card with their LIC policy numbers to be eligible for
                              the Policyholder quota in the LIC IPO</p>
                            <p>LIC Policyholders of active policies have been allocated a special 10% quota by the
                              government. So out of the total issue size of 31.63 crore shares in the LIC IPO, 3.16
                              crore shares will be reserved for the LIC policyholders. In addition, policyholders will
                              also get a discount of 10% on the stated price band. However, to get these benefits, then
                              must ensure that their PAN cards are linked to the LIC policy on the LIC website. This
                              linking is essential for all those who apply under the LIC policyholder quota. Here is how
                              to do the linking.</p>

                              It really cannot delay much beyond that as the government is intent to list LIC in this
